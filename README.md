# food-app

my first react js project will go into this repository - lets see how I can rock it

- First steps will be to use the npm create-react-app package to build the project structure https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app/tutorial

- Second step will be to setup the project structur:
  - view 1: recipe overview
    - teaser w/ title, thumbnail, shortdescription, category
  - view 2: recipes:
    - title
    - image
    - category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
    - time to cook
    - description
    - ingredients for one portion (option to submit to shopping card, option to mark as favorit if logged in)
  - view 3: shopping card
    - sum of ingredients
    - button to send via email/whatsapp or maybe API to another shopping app like "Bring"
